Transformer:

The Transformer is a deep learning model architecture introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. in 2017. It is primarily used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as machine translation, text generation, and language understanding. The key innovation of the Transformer is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when processing each word. The Transformer architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder, each composed of multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms and feedforward neural networks. Unlike traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the Transformer model does not rely on sequential processing, making it highly parallelizable and efficient for training on large datasets. The Transformer has become the foundation for many state-of-the-art NLP models, including BERT, GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), and T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer).

Scratch:

"From scratch" refers to building something, typically a machine learning model, from the ground up without relying on pre-existing implementations or libraries. When you build a model from scratch, you start with basic components such as layers, activation functions, loss functions, and optimization algorithms, and then write the code to implement them yourself. Building a model from scratch allows for a deeper understanding of the underlying principles and algorithms involved in machine learning and deep learning. It is often used for educational purposes or when there are specific requirements or constraints that cannot be met by existing libraries or frameworks.

Feedforward Network:

A feedforward neural network (also known as a multilayer perceptron or MLP) is a type of artificial neural network where connections between nodes do not form a cycle or loop. In a feedforward network, information flows in one direction, from the input layer through one or more hidden layers to the output layer. Each layer consists of neurons (or units) that perform a weighted sum of the inputs followed by an activation function. Feedforward networks are characterized by their simplicity and flexibility and are commonly used for tasks such as classification, regression, and function approximation. While feedforward networks can model complex nonlinear relationships, they may struggle with sequential data or tasks requiring memory, which has led to the development of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and other more advanced architectures.

PyTorch Library:

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR). It provides a flexible and dynamic computational graph framework for building and training deep learning models. Key features of PyTorch include: Tensor computation: PyTorch provides a powerful tensor library similar to NumPy but with support for GPU acceleration. Automatic differentiation: PyTorch's autograd module enables automatic differentiation of tensors, allowing for efficient computation of gradients during training. Dynamic computation graph: Unlike static computation graphs in libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch uses a dynamic computation graph, which allows for more flexible model architectures and easier debugging. Rich ecosystem: PyTorch has a vibrant ecosystem with extensive documentation, community support, and libraries for various tasks such as computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. PyTorch is widely used by researchers and practitioners for prototyping, research, and production-level deployment of deep learning models.
